<!-- The TypeScript service is hosted using [Railway](https://railway.app/), where following considerations apply:

> **Note:** As of November 2023, choosing your [build providers](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/builds#build-providers) is a [Priority Boarding](https://docs.railway.app/reference/priority-boarding) feature, where you'll have to link your Discord account to support this.

1. When registering each service, set the `build` command to something useless (e.g. `node -v`) and run only a single service at a time (e.g. `npm run build -- --service service && npm run launch -- --service service`).
2. For each service, generate a domain in the Networking tab. Paste this into the `commoners.config.ts` file -->

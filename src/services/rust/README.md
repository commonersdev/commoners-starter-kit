# Rust Demo Server (coming soon)
This is a simple Rust server that demonstrates how to use the `commoners` library to create a server that listens for incoming connections and responds to them.

This will be based on [this tutorial](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).
